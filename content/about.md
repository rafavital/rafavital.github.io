Hello, my name is Rafael Vital and I'm a Brazilian Indie Game Developer. 

I am from Bahia, Brazil. I studied Digital Games at the [State University of Bahia (UNEB)](https://portal.uneb.br/)

My main skill is programming but I also like to dabble with different areas of game development such as game design and art. Here is my resume.
